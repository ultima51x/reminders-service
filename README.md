# Reminders

Python code which interfaces with a spreadsheet on Airtable.

I'm not sure what it will do quite yet.

## Development

To install packages locally:

```sh
pipenv install -e .
```

To launch a shell within the pipenv for development:
```sh
pipenv shell
```

Automated Tests
```sh
pytest
```

In Python, to reload code
```python
reload(name_of_module)
# then do import statement again
```
